# Beta-TicTacToe
<p>This is supposed to be an entertaining project. I am too lazy to write a description about this. May revise this later.</p>

<p>For training, just run the following script:</p>
<pre><code>python robot.py</code></pre>

<p>After training, you can play with it by running the script:</p>
<pre><code>python test.py</code></pre>

<strong>To be continued! Have Fun~</strong>
